# ***1. Introduction***

	This document contains the development process for creating  APP TODO List for Embrace IT made as an intership exercise  in company.

	The requirements for this project are found in the request.pdf document provided by the  person in charge of the internship.

	With this document, it was agreed sending weekly email on the first day  to those responsible for the internships.

	This email will include the work sequence for that week, and on the last day of the week,  this sequence will be verified through repositories or  relevant documentation.

# ***2. Tutorial Followed***

	In my search of information, I found this tutorial wich explains all the concepts we need to implement in backend Structure :

# ***3. Project Structure.***
  
  - Empty solution creation.
  - Projects creation as library classes:  Domain, Data, Application.
  - MinimalApi Project creation.

# ***4. Domain Layer.***

- Model folder created inside Domain Library Class containning entity models:
  
  - Task
  - Tag
  - Category
  - SubTask
  - TaskTag
  - TaskCategory
  - User (Deleted)

*Modified Models for Identity implementation.

# ***5. Data Layer.***

- AppDbContext file created inside Data layer.
- Configurations added :

```
  protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
            
            modelBuilder.ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly(typeof(AppDbContext).Assembly);
```

- AppDbContext modified to heredate IdentityDbContext.

- Nuget Packages :
  - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer. 
  - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.
  - Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore.

- Repositories folder created containing implementation for repositories interfaces.
  - CategoryRepository
  - SubTaskRepository
  - TagRepository
  - taskRepository

	*Clases were modified to Identity implementation

- Configurations folder containing external entities configuration used in dbcontext :

  - CategoryConfiguration
  - SubTaskConfiguration
  - TagConfiguration
  - TaskConfiguration
  - UserConfiguration (Deleted)
  - TaskTagConfiguration
  - TaskCategoryConfiguration

	*Modified configurations to implement Identity User.

- Identity Folder added to contain Application user model.

- Migrations folder generated in this Layer for Data Base Migration.
  

# ***6. Application Layer.***
	
- Abstractions Folder on Application Project Containning Repository Interfaces for Repository Pattern.

  - ICategoryRepository
  - ISubTaskRepository
  - ITagRepository
  - ITaskRepository
  - IuserRepository (Deleted)
  - ITokenService

# ***7. Minimal API.***

  - This project is set as single startup project in Solution.
    
  - Repositories Dependency Injection register in Program.cs :

  ```
    builder.Services.AddScoped<ITaskRepository,TaskRepository>();
    builder.Services.AddScoped<ICategoryRepository, CategoryRepository>();
    builder.Services.AddScoped<ITagRepository, TagRepository>();
    builder.Services.AddScoped<ISubTaskRepository, SubTaskRepository>();
  ```

  - DbContext Dependency Injection register in Program.cs:
  ```
    builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>();   
  ```

  - Dependency Injection for Identity implementation in Program.cs.
  
  - Connection String added on appsettings.json.

  - Packages installation:

    - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.
    - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.
    - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools

# ***Next WeekÂ´s Sprint (10/20)***

- JWT
- Solve DEPENDENCY CYCLE between Application and Data.
- Modificate Repositories for Linq Qeries addition.
- Middlewares.
- Minimal API Controllers Based.
- Start Angular Learning.

# ***JWT***

- Add configurations in appsetting.json.
- Interface ITokenService.cs creation in Data/Abstractions.
- implementing interface TokenService.cs in Data/Services.
- JWT configuration in Program.cs(Authentication, DI and Middleware)
- Auth endpoints and DTO's creation.
- Identity integration.

# ***Solving Dependency Cycle***

- Abstractions Folder on Application Project Containning Repository Interfaces for Repository Pattern Moved To Domain Project to solve dependency Cycle.

  - ICategoryRepository.
  - ISubTaskRepository.
  - ITagRepository.
  - ITaskRepository.
 
- Abstractions/ITokenService.cs moved from Appplication project to solve Dependency Cycle.

- Services/TokenService.cs moved from Application Layer to solve dependency Cycle.

  # ***Linq Queries***

  - All Repositories classes were modified to implement LINQ syntax queries
